get id string
digit by digit
if digit max
	it becomes max

at end of lines, get whenever a digit incrememented
	that is where there is a new branch
	branch is made by looking at where x < maxDigit
	x is all digits in that place


ex. (digits start at 0 btw, 123, first number is 2)

0 <- zero doesnt count
00
1
11
111
1111
112
1121
2
21
211
22
222

branches are:
	(1,2) //zero doesnt count lol
	(111,112)
	(21,22)
because for depth 0 in branch 0, the 0th digit incremented (twice!) so there is a branch at everything in the 0th place
	for depth 1 in branch 1, the digits did not increment in the 1 branch in the first place (11,111,1111,112,1121)
	for depth 2 in branch 1, the 2nd digit incremented, so there is a branch at everything in the 2nd place 
	for depth 



break up csv file into json based on branches
each json is a branch
