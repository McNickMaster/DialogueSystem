11,Amelia Watson,“Well what do you need?”
111,You,“Got any theories to share with me?”
1111,Amelia Watson,"“Nothing yet, I’ve gotta take a closer look at this damage and see what could’ve done something like this.”[back11]"
112,You,“I just got some questions.”
1121,Amelia Watson,“Sure thing.”
11211,You,“How bad’s the damage?”
112111,Amelia Watson,"“Not the worst, whatever attacked either did a poor job of sinking the ship, or it was just targeting whoever was onboard.”[back1121]"
11212,You,“What happened to the victim?”
112121,Amelia Watson,"“Had their hand bitten off– or… well, their hand had them bitten off. Wasn’t a clean cut either.”[back1121]"

2111,Amelia Watson,"“On the boat? Not bad, I mean, it managed to still drift back to shore. Whatever attacked it didn’t intend to sink it, I don’t think. The marks look like it was getting at something onboard.”[back21]"
212,You,“What’s the deal with the hand?”
2121,Amelia Watson,“Bitten clean off– well… not really actually”
