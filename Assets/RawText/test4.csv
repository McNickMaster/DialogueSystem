1,You,“Whatcha got there?”
11,Edo,*Edo barks*
111,You,“C’mere boy!”
1111,Edo,"*Edo stares at you till you walk over. You see what he’s found, tiny gray flecks on the ground. Scales… or maybe feathers, hard to tell* [end]"

31,Technician,"*One of the technicians walks over to Edo, and bags up something from the ground. They walk over and hand it to you*"
311,You,“Thanks”
3111,Technician,"“No prob.” *Inside the bag, some small gray flecks. Looks like scales maybe… or feathers?* [end]"
312,You,*Wordlessly accept it*

@0,Eric Meng,"“Hey Detective, don’t mind me”"
1,You,"“I do mind, so you better get out of my face”"
11,Eric Meng,"“Duly noted, I’ll be outta here soon” [end]"
2,You,“I’m glad to see you”
21,Eric Meng,“Happy to hear it. What’s up?”
211,You,“Do you recognize anything here?”
2111,Eric Meng,"“Believe it or not I do, the driver was a frequent hunter around these parts. Member of the Abra Hunting Club.” [back21] [unlock214]"
212,You,“Anything strange stick out to you?”
2121,Eric Meng,"“Those footprints do, they start and stop without warning. Maybe they jumped away.” [back21]"
213,You,"“Not much, what’s up with you?”"
2131,Eric Meng,“Doing my job I’m afraid” [end]
214,You,[locked] “What do you know about the victim?”
2141,Eric Meng,"“He liked to talk a big game about how he could take on many of the supernatural elements that live around here, always spoutin’ off his plans.” [back21]"
3,You,“I got some questions for you”
31,Eric Meng,“I bet you do”
311,You,“Do you recognize anything here?”
3111,Eric Meng,"“I recognize the guy. Frequent hunter around these parts, member of the Abra Hunting Club.”"
31111,Eric Meng,"“I notice his gun there too, but I wonder why he doesn’t have the rest of his equipment.” [back31]"
312,You,“Anything strange stick out to you?”
3121,Eric Meng,"“Those footprints do, they start and stop without warning, and they definitely don’t look human”"
31211,Eric Meng,“Maybe it’s got other means of getting around.” [back31]
313,You,"“Actually, I think I got all I need” [end]"
@0,Officer Jameson,“Good evening Detective.”
1,You,"“You were the first officer on scene, correct?”"
11,Officer Jameson,“That’s correct.”
111,You,“Who called it in?”
1111,Officer Jameson,"“Some local saw it first, called it in but didn’t stick around” [back11]"
112,You,“What’d you see when you got here?”
1121,Officer Jameson,"“Everything you see here, except the driver was still alive.” [back11] [unlock115]"
113,You,“When did you get here?”
1131,Officer Jameson,“Around 1:30 I wanna say?” [back11]
114,You,"“That’s all for now, thanks” [end]"
115,You,[locked] “He was still alive?”
1151,Officer Jameson,"“Yep, when I arrived it looked like he was frozen to his seat. I snapped him out of it I think, but then he just started spouting nonsense”"
11511,Officer Jameson,"“I removed him from the truck, and he wasn’t even bleeding that badly, but then next thing you know he collapses into me, dead.” [back11]"
2,You,"“‘Good’ is debatable, given the circumstances”"
21,Officer Jameson,“I’m doing fine.”
211,You,"“Not the point, listen, can you answer some questions?”"
2111,Officer Jameson,“If I gotta” [back213]
212,You,“Hm. You got a minute?”
2121,Officer Jameson,“I guess.” [back213]
213,You,*jump right to your questions*
2131,You,“Who called it in?”
21311,Officer Jameson,"“Oh I dunno, some local driver. Doubt he stuck around” [back213]"
2132,You,“What’d you see when you got here?”
21321,Officer Jameson,"“All this, just darker. Oh, and the driver was alive I suppose.” [back213] [unlock2135]"
2133,You,“When did you get here?”
21331,Officer Jameson,“Sometime around 1:30” [back213]
2134,You,"“That’s all for now, thanks” [end]"
2135,You,[locked] “You said he was still alive?”
21351,Officer Jameson,"“Yep, when I arrived it looked like he was frozen to his seat. I snapped him out of it I think, but then he just started spouting nonsense”"
213511,Officer Jameson,"“I removed him from the truck, and he wasn’t even bleeding that badly, but then next thing you know he collapses into me, dead.” [back213]"
3,You,“I have some questions”
31,Officer Jameson,“Shoot.”
311,You,"“You were the first one here, right?”"
3111,Officer Jameson,"“Yep. Some local called in a crash, I got here right before the ambulance, tried helping the driver out of the truck.” [back31] [unlock 315]"
312,You,“When did this happen?”
3121,Officer Jameson,"“Oh I dunno, I got here around 1:30. The crash couldn’t have happened too much earlier than that"" [back31]"
313,You,“Put anything together yourself?”
3131,Officer Jameson,"“I’ve put together that some idiot lost control of his vehicle and crashed it, killing himself in the process. Why’re you here again?” [back31] [unlock316]"
314,You,“I think that’s everything” [end]
315,You,[locked] “What condition was the driver in?”
3151,Officer Jameson,"“He was still alive, at first he wasn’t responsive at all, but I think I snapped him out of it when I tried moving him, and he lost it.”"
31511,You,“What do you mean he ‘lost it’?”
315111,Officer Jameson,"“Like, rambling and sputtering, all nonsense, but he must’ve tired himself out cause after a bit he collapsed.” [back31]"
31512,You,“How hurt was he?”
315121,Officer Jameson,"“He didn’t look too bad to be honest. I’ve seen more people survive worse, sure he was bleeding, but nowhere important. But then, after a minute, the poor dude just collapsed into me.” [back31]"
31513,You,“Crash must’ve rattled him badly” [back31]
316,You,[locked] “I’m here cause it’s not as simple as that”
3161,Officer Jameson,“Why’d you even bother to ask” [back31]
@0,Eric Meng,"“Good afternoon, Detective”"
1,You,“What’s up?”
11,Eric Meng,"“Just doin’ my job, you just come by to chat?”"
111,You,"""Yep, not too worried about this case”"
1111,Eric Meng,"“That’s either a great sign, or a terrible one” [end]"
112,You,"“Nah, just got some questions for you”"
1121,Eric Meng,“I see.”
11211,You,“What do you make of this?”
112111,Eric Meng,"“I dunno, looks like some washed up wreck, definitely got attacked out there, but who knows why” [back1121]"
11212,You,“This doesn’t happen often does it?”
112121,Eric Meng,"“No it does not, and good thing too, given a lot of ours dependence on the water” [back1121] [unlock11215]"
11213,You,“Do you know anything about this victim?”
112131,Eric Meng,"“All I see is a hand, so I don’t know how I’d recognize them.” [back1121] [unlock11216]"
11214,You,“I think that’s everything” [end]
11215,You,[locked] “Why isn’t this more common?”
112151,Eric Meng,"“Most creatures in the sea aren’t that aggressive, especially towards big ships with barely any meat on them. This couldn’t have been a random attack.” [back1121]"
11216,You,"[locked] “Must’ve been a fisher though, right?”"
112161,Eric Meng,"“This is a fishing ship, but I don’t see the typical equipment. Plenty of fishermen have odd jobs around here, maybe they were on an errand.” [back1121]"
2,You,"“Good afternoon, just got a few questions.”"
21,Eric Meng,"“Sure thing, ask away”"
211,You,“Notice anything off?”
2111,Eric Meng,“The only thing off is this whole ordeal.”
21111,Eric Meng,"“These sorts of attacks almost never happen, Abra’s sea creatures don’t bother us lest we bother them.” [back21] [unlock215]"
212,You,“Know anything about the victim?”
2121,Eric Meng,"“It’s just a hand, so– no. The most I can surmise is they were a fisher.” [back21]"
213,You,“Know anything about the ship?”
2131,Eric Meng,"“Seems like a standard gillnetter, fishing ship, though they could’ve been using it for anything. A lot of sailors in Oldport have side-gigs.” [back21]"
214,You,"“Thanks for your help, that’s all” [end]"
215,You,[locked] “What could the victim have done to provoke something?”
2151,Eric Meng,"“Besides attacking them? I got no clue, unless the captain was a fool, they would’ve known not to harass anything.” [back21]"
3,You,“You got a minute?”
31,Eric Meng,"“Just one, why?”"
311,You,“I’ll make it quick then”
3111,Eric Meng,“Better get to your point” [back31]
312,You,“What’ve you put together so far?”
3121,Eric Meng,"“Not much, the ship was obviously attacked, but by what? Oldport’s sailors know better than to provoke any sea creatures.” [back31] [unlock316]"
313,You,“Have you seen this happen before?”
3131,Eric Meng,"“A wreck like this? Almost never happens, good thing too, given the town’s dependence on the water.” [back31]"
314,You,“Know anything about the ship or crew?”
3141,Eric Meng,"“Typical gillnetter like this would just have one or two people manning it, given that there’s just the one hand and no other signs, I’m assuming just one sailor.” [back31] [unlock317]"
315,You,"“My minute’s up, that’s everything.” [end]"
316,You,[locked] “What would provoke something?”
3161,Eric Meng,"“Oh I dunno, attacking it I guess? Staying too long in its territory maybe?” [back31]"
317,You,"[locked] “Gillnetter, that a fishing vessel?”"
3171,Eric Meng,"“Most often, though so many sailors around here have odd jobs, who knows what they were up to” [back31]"
4,You,“Not so good now that you’re here.”
41,Eric Meng,"“Y’know, I don’t know what your problem with me is” [end]"
@0,Old Sailor,“Oh! Hello there sir”
1,You,“I have some questions for you.”
11,Old Sailor,"“Who, me? I don’t know how much help I’ll be, but okay.”"
111,You,“Do you live or work in the area?”
1111,Old Sailor,"“Aye! I’m a sailor here in Oldport, mostly fishing, sometime tours, odd jobs.” [back11][unlock115]"
112,You,“Do you recognize the ship?”
1121,Old Sailor,"“Yessir, that’s a gillnetter. Fishing ship, decent enough to get you as far as Pettiget by the looks of it.” [back11]"
113,You,“Know what could’ve done this?”
1131,Old Sailor,"“Ah hell, no clue. We’ve got a lot of sea beasties in this lake, but us sailors know how to avoid them and they know to avoid us, so I dunno what changed here.” [back11]"
114,You,“No further questions.” [end]
115,You,"[locked] ""Do a lot of people here have odd jobs?”"
1151,Old Sailor,"“Oh for sure, most people I know got a side gig or two. Most commonly quick trips to Pettiget, sometimes passengers, sometimes cargo.” [back11]"
2,You,"""Hello, you are?”"
21,Fred Fiegel,“Fred Fiegel! Captain of the Betty Blue.”
211,You,“Can you tell me what kind of ship that is?”
2111,Fred Fiegel,"“That there’s a gillnetter, fishin’ ship mostly, though some just use ‘em to sail around, maybe back and forth between Pettiget.” [back21]"
212,You,“Do you recognize that ship?”
2121,Fred Fiegel,"“The specific one? Nah, can’t say I do. I’m sure I’ve probably seen it around here before, but my memory’s not what it used to be.” [back21]"
213,You,“Do you know the area well?”
2131,Fred Fiegel,“Like the back of my hand!” [back21 [unlock215] [unlock216]
214,You,"“Thanks for your help, that’ll be all” [end]"
215,You,[locked] “What can you tell me about the route to Pettiget from here?”
2151,Fred Fiegel,"“The water’s not too treacherous on its own, but the visibility is often pretty shit. Were someone to sail on their own they’d need to be fairly experienced.” [back21]"
216,You,[locked] “What can you tell me about the creatures that live in the lake?”
2161,Fred Fiegel,"“Oh there’s plenty, a few make their homes around Pettiget, nests and whatnot. Though we’ve got all those spots marked so we know to avoid ‘em.” [back21]"
3,You,"“Hello, you have a minute?”"
31,Old Sailor,"“Oh sure thing, d’ya need me for something?”"
311,You,"""Just need you to answer some questions.”"
3111,You,“What could’ve done this to a ship?”
31111,Old Sailor,"“Oh there’s plenty that could’ve, but I dunno many that would’ve. No real reason for our beasties to attack us, we’re hardly worth the trouble to eat.” [back311]"
3112,You,“What was this ship doing out there?”
31121,Old Sailor,"“Coulda been just out fishing, but I don’t see any big nets prepared. They might have been doin’ some errands, lotta sailors get hired to transport things to and from Pettiget.” [back311]"
3113,You,“Where would this ship have been sailing?”
31131,Old Sailor,"“Either sittin’ out in the open water, or to Pettiget Island.”"
311311,Old Sailor,“The trip across the lake ain’t really viable.” [back311]
312,You,“I was wondering if you had any insights?”
3121,Old Sailor,“Insights into what? The wreck? Oh jeez I dunno”
31211,You,“Just– tell me if you know anything useful”
312111,Old Sailor,"“Ah heck, I dunno what you’d think is useful. That’s a gillnetter there, doesn’t go far, so I dunno what could’ve wrecked it. Nothin’ between here and Pettiget ever really attacks us sailors” [back3121] [unlock31214]"
31212,You,"""Any clue what caused the wreck?”"
312121,Old Sailor,"“I mean that’s some nasty damage to the hull, no ordinary crash I can tell you that!” [back3121]"
31213,You,“Nevermind.” [end]
31214,You,[locked] “What sorts of things live between here and Pettiget?”
312141,Old Sailor,"“Ohhh, the Mahamba and Nguma-monene are the first to mind, but neither would attack a ship like this unless they were like– personally pissed!” [back3121]"
313,You,“Tell me who you are.”
3131,Old Sailor,"“Oh! Fred Fiegel, I’m a sailor ‘round here” [back3121]"
@0,Amelia Watson,“Can I help you?”
1,You,"“Yes you can, as a matter of fact.”"
11,Amelia Watson,“Well what do you need?”
111,You,“Got any theories to share with me?”
1111,Amelia Watson,"“Nothing yet, I’ve gotta take a closer look at this damage and see what could’ve done something like this.” [back11]"
112,You,“I just got some questions.”
1121,Amelia Watson,“Sure thing.”
11211,You,“How bad’s the damage?”
112111,Amelia Watson,"“Not the worst, whatever attacked either did a poor job of sinking the ship, or it was just targeting whoever was onboard.” [back1121]"
11212,You,“What happened to the victim?”
112121,Amelia Watson,"“Had their hand bitten off– or… well, their hand had them bitten off. Wasn’t a clean cut either.” [back1121]"
11213,You,“Care to share your pictures with me?”
112131,Amelia Watson,“I’ll send them over once I’m done with them.” [back1121]
11214,You,“That’s all.” [end]
113,You,“I need copies of the pictures you’re taking.”
1131,Amelia Watson,“I’ll send them over to your office asap.” [back11]
114,You,“I’m all set.” [end]
2,You,“What’re you doing?”
21,Amelia Watson,"“Investigating, organizing, snapping pictures, that sorta thing.”"
211,You,“How bad’s the damage?”
2111,Amelia Watson,"“On the boat? Not bad, I mean, it managed to still drift back to shore. Whatever attacked it didn’t intend to sink it, I don’t think. The marks look like it was getting at something onboard.” [back21]"
212,You,“What’s the deal with the hand?”
2121,Amelia Watson,“Bitten clean off– well… not really actually”
21211,Amelia Watson,"“The body was bitten off the hand, and it wasn’t a clean bite either.” [back21]"
213,You,“I need whatever information you’ve gathered here.”
2131,Amelia Watson,“I suppose I could send my photos over once I’m done with them.” [back21]
214,You,"“That’s all I need to know, thanks” [end]"
