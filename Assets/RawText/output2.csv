0,Officer Jameson,“Good evening Detective.”
1,You,"“You were the first officer on scene, correct?”"
11,Officer Jameson,“That’s correct.”
111,You,“Who called it in?”
1111,Officer Jameson,"“Some local saw it first, called it in but didn’t stick around”[back11]"
112,You,“What’d you see when you got here?”
113,You,“When did you get here?”
1131,Officer Jameson,“Around 1:30 I wanna say?”[back11]
114,You,"“That’s all for now, thanks”[end]"
115,You,[locked] “He was still alive?”
1151,Officer Jameson,"“Yep, when I arrived it looked like he was frozen to his seat. I snapped him out of it I think, but then he just started spouting nonsense”"
11511,Officer Jameson,"“I removed him from the truck, and he wasn’t even bleeding that badly, but then next thing you know he collapses into me, dead.”[back11]"
2,You,"“‘Good’ is debatable, given the circumstances”"
21,Officer Jameson,“I’m doing fine.”
211,You,"“Not the point, listen, can you answer some questions?”"
2111,Officer Jameson,“If I gotta”[back213]
212,You,“Hm. You got a minute?”
2121,Officer Jameson,“I guess.”[back213]
213,You,*jump right to your questions*
2131,You,“Who called it in?”
21311,Officer Jameson,"“Oh I dunno, some local driver. Doubt he stuck around”[back213]"
2132,You,“What’d you see when you got here?”
21321,Officer Jameson,"“All this, just darker. Oh, and the driver was alive I suppose.”[back213][unlock2135]"
2133,You,“When did you get here?”
21331,Officer Jameson,“Sometime around 1:30”[back213]
2134,You,"“That’s all for now, thanks”[end]"
2135,You,[locked] “You said he was still alive?”
21351,Officer Jameson,"“Yep, when I arrived it looked like he was frozen to his seat. I snapped him out of it I think, but then he just started spouting nonsense”"
213511,Officer Jameson,"“I removed him from the truck, and he wasn’t even bleeding that badly, but then next thing you know he collapses into me, dead.”[back213]"
3,You,“I have some questions”
31,Officer Jameson,“Shoot.”
311,You,"“You were the first one here, right?”"
3111,Officer Jameson,"“Yep. Some local called in a crash, I got here right before the ambulance, tried helping the driver out of the truck.”[back31][unlock 315]"
312,You,“When did this happen?”
3121,Officer Jameson,"“Oh I dunno, I got here around 1:30. The crash couldn’t have happened too much earlier than that"" [back31]"
313,You,“Put anything together yourself?”
3131,Officer Jameson,"“I’ve put together that some idiot lost control of his vehicle and crashed it, killing himself in the process. Why’re you here again?”[back31][unlock316]"
314,You,“I think that’s everything”[end]
315,You,[locked] “What condition was the driver in?”
3151,Officer Jameson,"“He was still alive, at first he wasn’t responsive at all, but I think I snapped him out of it when I tried moving him, and he lost it.”"
31511,You,“What do you mean he ‘lost it’?”
315111,Officer Jameson,"“Like, rambling and sputtering, all nonsense, but he must’ve tired himself out cause after a bit he collapsed.”[back31]"
31512,You,“How hurt was he?”
315121,Officer Jameson,"“He didn’t look too bad to be honest. I’ve seen more people survive worse, sure he was bleeding, but nowhere important. But then, after a minute, the poor dude just collapsed into me.”[back31]"
31513,You,“Crash must’ve rattled him badly”[back31]
316,You,[locked] “I’m here cause it’s not as simple as that”
3161,Officer Jameson,“Why’d you even bother to ask”[back31]
