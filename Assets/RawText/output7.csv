1112,You,You: “What does Evan do for work?”
11121,Vivian DeTour,"“He works at some dock in Abra City, I couldn’t tell you why. He was always more of a fan of the mountains and forests. He doesn’t even like the water.”[back111]"
1113,You,You: “Does Evan own a brown fishing jacket?”
11131,Vivian DeTour,"“Fishing jacket? I doubt it, are you sure it wasn’t some sort of hiking gear? That’d be him.”[back111]"

21211,Vivian DeTour,“What else do you want to know?”
21221,You,You: “Why’d he hate his work?”
212211,Vivian DeTour,"“He hates the water, really, always hated boats. I think he only works at the dock cause… well… it’s all he could get.”[back2122]"
