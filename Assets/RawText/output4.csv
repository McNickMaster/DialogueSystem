0,Old Sailor,“Oh! Hello there sir”
1,You,“I have some questions for you.”
11,Old Sailor,"“Who, me? I don’t know how much help I’ll be, but okay.”"
111,You,“Do you live or work in the area?”
1111,Old Sailor,"“Aye! I’m a sailor here in Oldport, mostly fishing, sometime tours, odd jobs.” [back11][unlock115]"
112,You,“Do you recognize the ship?”
1121,Old Sailor,"“Yessir, that’s a gillnetter. Fishing ship, decent enough to get you as far as Pettiget by the looks of it.” [back11]"
113,You,“Know what could’ve done this?”
1131,Old Sailor,"“Ah hell, no clue. We’ve got a lot of sea beasties in this lake, but us sailors know how to avoid them and they know to avoid us, so I dunno what changed here.” [back11]"
114,You,“No further questions.” [end]
115,You,"[locked] ""Do a lot of people here have odd jobs?”"
1151,Old Sailor,"“Oh for sure, most people I know got a side gig or two. Most commonly quick trips to Pettiget, sometimes passengers, sometimes cargo.” [back11]"
2,You,"""Hello, you are?”"
21,Fred Fiegel,“Fred Fiegel! Captain of the Betty Blue.”
211,You,“Can you tell me what kind of ship that is?”
2111,Fred Fiegel,"“That there’s a gillnetter, fishin’ ship mostly, though some just use ‘em to sail around, maybe back and forth between Pettiget.” [back21]"
212,You,“Do you recognize that ship?”
2121,Fred Fiegel,"“The specific one? Nah, can’t say I do. I’m sure I’ve probably seen it around here before, but my memory’s not what it used to be.” [back21]"
213,You,“Do you know the area well?”
2131,Fred Fiegel,“Like the back of my hand!” [back21 [unlock215] [unlock216]
214,You,"“Thanks for your help, that’ll be all” [end]"
215,You,[locked] “What can you tell me about the route to Pettiget from here?”
2151,Fred Fiegel,"“The water’s not too treacherous on its own, but the visibility is often pretty shit. Were someone to sail on their own they’d need to be fairly experienced.” [back21]"
216,You,[locked] “What can you tell me about the creatures that live in the lake?”
2161,Fred Fiegel,"“Oh there’s plenty, a few make their homes around Pettiget, nests and whatnot. Though we’ve got all those spots marked so we know to avoid ‘em.” [back21]"
3,You,"“Hello, you have a minute?”"
31,Old Sailor,"“Oh sure thing, d’ya need me for something?”"
311,You,"""Just need you to answer some questions.”"
3111,You,“What could’ve done this to a ship?”
31111,Old Sailor,"“Oh there’s plenty that could’ve, but I dunno many that would’ve. No real reason for our beasties to attack us, we’re hardly worth the trouble to eat.” [back311]"
3112,You,“What was this ship doing out there?”
31121,Old Sailor,"“Coulda been just out fishing, but I don’t see any big nets prepared. They might have been doin’ some errands, lotta sailors get hired to transport things to and from Pettiget.” [back311]"
3113,You,“Where would this ship have been sailing?”
31131,Old Sailor,"“Either sittin’ out in the open water, or to Pettiget Island.”"
311311,Old Sailor,“The trip across the lake ain’t really viable.” [back311]
312,You,“I was wondering if you had any insights?”
3121,Old Sailor,“Insights into what? The wreck? Oh jeez I dunno”
31211,You,“Just– tell me if you know anything useful”
312111,Old Sailor,"“Ah heck, I dunno what you’d think is useful. That’s a gillnetter there, doesn’t go far, so I dunno what could’ve wrecked it. Nothin’ between here and Pettiget ever really attacks us sailors” [back3121] [unlock31214]"
31212,You,"""Any clue what caused the wreck?”"
312121,Old Sailor,"“I mean that’s some nasty damage to the hull, no ordinary crash I can tell you that!” [back3121]"
31213,You,“Nevermind.” [end]
31214,You,[locked] “What sorts of things live between here and Pettiget?”
312141,Old Sailor,"“Ohhh, the Mahamba and Nguma-monene are the first to mind, but neither would attack a ship like this unless they were like– personally pissed!” [back3121]"
313,You,“Tell me who you are.”
3131,Old Sailor,"“Oh! Fred Fiegel, I’m a sailor ‘round here” [back3121]"
