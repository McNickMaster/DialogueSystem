11,Daisy Beebug,“You are. Who is this?”
111,You,"“I’m with the ACPD, calling about Tara Pesci.”"
1111,Daisy Beebug,"“Oh oh oh, do you have any leads yet?”"
11111,Daisy Beebug,"“I’m starting to be really worried, like– even more worried than I already was.”"
111111,You,"“Possibly, I need you to answer some questions to help.”"
1111111,Daisy Beebug,"“Ok, of course, what do you need to know?”"
11111111,You,“When did you last see Tara?”
111111111,Daisy Beebug,"“April 9th, she went out to work at the same time she always does.”"
1111111111,Daisy Beebug,"“Even though she didn’t come home that night, I didn’t think much of it, she typically hangs out with friends way past when I go to sleep.”"
11111111111,Daisy Beebug,"“When I woke up and she wasn’t there, that’s when I knew something was wrong.” [back1111111]"

11111113,You,“Does Tara own a brown fishing jacket?”

11111114,You,“Does Tara own a boat?”
111111141,Daisy Beebug,"“Mhm. It’s– kind of falling apart, but she loves it.” [back1111111]"

111112,You,"“We’re working on it, I’m sure she’s okay, I just have some questions for you.” [back1111111]"
112,You,“I’m a detective.”
1121,Daisy Beebug,“...is this about Tara?”
11211,You,"“Yes, I’ve just got a few questions.” [back1111111]"
2,You,"“Hi, I’m calling with a few questions about Tara Pesci.”"

21113,You,“Does Tara own a brown fishing jacket?”
211131,Daisy Beebug,“Does she– what? Why is that relevant?”
2111311,You,“One was found in a wreck that just washed up.”
21113111,Daisy Beebug,“Wh- what? Oh… weird.”
211131111,Daisy Beebug,"“Uh, no, she doesn’t have a brown jacket. Brown doesn’t suit her.” [back2111]"
2111312,You,“I didn’t write the questions.”
21113121,Daisy Beebug,"“Okayyy… well, no, she doesn’t have one.” [back2111]"
21114,You,“Does Tara own a boat?”

21115,You,"“That’s everything, thanks for your time.” [end]"
212,You,“I’m a detective.”
2121,Daisy Beebug,“Oh! Have you found her? Do you have a lead?”
21211,You,“We’re working on it.”
212111,Daisy Beebug,"“Well, ask your questions then!” [back1111111]"
