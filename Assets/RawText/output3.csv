0,Eric Meng,"“Good afternoon, Detective”"
1,You,“What’s up?”
11,Eric Meng,"“Just doin’ my job, you just come by to chat?”"
111,You,"""Yep, not too worried about this case”"
1111,Eric Meng,"“That’s either a great sign, or a terrible one” [end]"
112,You,"“Nah, just got some questions for you”"
1121,Eric Meng,“I see.”
11211,You,“What do you make of this?”
112111,Eric Meng,"“I dunno, looks like some washed up wreck, definitely got attacked out there, but who knows why” [back1121]"
11212,You,“This doesn’t happen often does it?”
112121,Eric Meng,"“No it does not, and good thing too, given a lot of ours dependence on the water” [back1121] [unlock11215]"
11213,You,“Do you know anything about this victim?”
112131,Eric Meng,"“All I see is a hand, so I don’t know how I’d recognize them.” [back1121] [unlock11216]"
11214,You,“I think that’s everything” [end]
11215,You,[locked] “Why isn’t this more common?”
112151,Eric Meng,"“Most creatures in the sea aren’t that aggressive, especially towards big ships with barely any meat on them. This couldn’t have been a random attack.” [back1121]"
11216,You,"[locked] “Must’ve been a fisher though, right?”"
112161,Eric Meng,"“This is a fishing ship, but I don’t see the typical equipment. Plenty of fishermen have odd jobs around here, maybe they were on an errand.” [back1121]"
2,You,"“Good afternoon, just got a few questions.”"
21,Eric Meng,"“Sure thing, ask away”"
211,You,“Notice anything off?”
2111,Eric Meng,“The only thing off is this whole ordeal.”
21111,Eric Meng,"“These sorts of attacks almost never happen, Abra’s sea creatures don’t bother us lest we bother them.” [back21] [unlock215]"
212,You,“Know anything about the victim?”
2121,Eric Meng,"“It’s just a hand, so– no. The most I can surmise is they were a fisher.” [back21]"
213,You,“Know anything about the ship?”
2131,Eric Meng,"“Seems like a standard gillnetter, fishing ship, though they could’ve been using it for anything. A lot of sailors in Oldport have side-gigs.” [back21]"
214,You,"“Thanks for your help, that’s all” [end]"
215,You,[locked] “What could the victim have done to provoke something?”
2151,Eric Meng,"“Besides attacking them? I got no clue, unless the captain was a fool, they would’ve known not to harass anything.” [back21]"
3,You,“You got a minute?”
31,Eric Meng,"“Just one, why?”"
311,You,“I’ll make it quick then”
3111,Eric Meng,“Better get to your point” [back31]
312,You,“What’ve you put together so far?”
3121,Eric Meng,"“Not much, the ship was obviously attacked, but by what? Oldport’s sailors know better than to provoke any sea creatures.” [back31] [unlock316]"
313,You,“Have you seen this happen before?”
3131,Eric Meng,"“A wreck like this? Almost never happens, good thing too, given the town’s dependence on the water.” [back31]"
314,You,“Know anything about the ship or crew?”
3141,Eric Meng,"“Typical gillnetter like this would just have one or two people manning it, given that there’s just the one hand and no other signs, I’m assuming just one sailor.” [back31] [unlock317]"
315,You,"“My minute’s up, that’s everything.” [end]"
316,You,[locked] “What would provoke something?”
3161,Eric Meng,"“Oh I dunno, attacking it I guess? Staying too long in its territory maybe?” [back31]"
317,You,"[locked] “Gillnetter, that a fishing vessel?”"
3171,Eric Meng,"“Most often, though so many sailors around here have odd jobs, who knows what they were up to” [back31]"
4,You,“Not so good now that you’re here.”
41,Eric Meng,"“Y’know, I don’t know what your problem with me is” [end]"
